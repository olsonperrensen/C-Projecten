This text contains the word dog multiple times.
For instance, when someone says dog, one thinks of a mammal
within the animal kingdom. 
But another word exists as well that starts with dog:
And that is the word dogmatic. Something of a dogma to begin
with. Even though it has nothing
to do with a dog, it still contains the word dog in it. 
As a flase prefix. Regardless of that, if we continue
down or approach to detecting words, let's better describe
what a dog is and what a dog does. A dog is one type of
animal that has been taimed by humans
and bred into a new species, descending from their ancestors
the wolves. One dog can be a man's life companion. They are
loyal beings. I would like to interview a dog but since at
the moment no dog can hold a human conversation nor understand
it it is fair to say a dog is a dog and so it will stay. 
In case this changes, then a dog to human communication would be
possible...

Three heads enriching a body of scars, Arriving to a fiery back-end of a dragon. \n\tHis sharp teeth he shows To those who have crossed the river Styx, To those who watch the years passing From chinks bleary, missing the sun. His skills are known, His power unique, as he eliminates any trespasser With nails keen. His eyes, these eyes combine fire with madness. \n\tInside them only Hell finds its missing shelter. In channels of terror he walks Day and night Carving threats to those who died, Yet face the misery of living inside those wet walls. Maybe he is the true Guard of great gates, \n\tSeparating those who live from those who left the seasons, Removing the coin from their mouth -The payment of a lifetime- Sending empty hands to empty cells. \n\tAnd he accepts no visitors, And he accepts no challenge, As he is forming circles around human shadows To mark his territory, as a real dog would do. \" \n\n";
